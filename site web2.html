<div class="justifier"><p>Since I was 15 years old, I have played handball until I reached a fairly high level, the one below the national level even if I have already played some matches at this level for cups. This sport allowed me to develop certain skills on team spirit and the desire to compete.</p></div>

 <div class="justifier"><p>From a very young age I did swimming until I was 15 years old because I loved swimming and especially beating my personal bests that I did during the competitions. I did a lot of competitions and on every competition I did, I always finished on the podium but I usually brought home silver medals and sometimes gold medals. But in no way was the 3rd place dedicated to me.</p></div>
